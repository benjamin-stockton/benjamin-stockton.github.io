  abstract = {Non-inferiority (NI) clinical trials' goal is to demonstrate that a new treatment is not worse than a standard of care by a certain amount called margin. The choice of non-inferiority margin is not straightforward as it depends on historical data, and clinical experts' opinion. Knowing the ``true'', objective clinical margin would be helpful for design and analysis of non-inferiority trials, but it is not possible in practice. We propose to treat non-inferiority margin as missing information. In order to recover an objective margin, we believe it is essential to conduct a survey among a group of representative clinical experts. We introduce a novel framework, where data obtained from a survey are combined with NI trial data, so that both an estimated clinically acceptable margin and its uncertainty are accounted for when claiming non-inferiority. Through simulations, we compare several methods for implementing this framework. We believe the proposed framework would lead to better informed decisions regarding new potentially non-inferior treatments and could help resolve current practical issues related to the choice of the margin.},

  abstract = {Sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) clinical trials aim to adjust active treatment effect estimates for placebo response to minimize the impact of placebo responders on the estimates. This is potentially accomplished using a two stage design by measuring treatment effects among all participants during the first stage, then classifying some placebo arm participants as placebo non-responders who will be re-randomized in the second stage. In this paper, we use causal inference tools to clarify under what assumptions treatment effects can be identified in SPCD trials and what effects the conventional estimators target at each stage of the SPCD trial. We further illustrate the highly influential impact of placebo response misclassification on the second stage estimate. We conclude that the conventional SPCD estimators do not target meaningful treatment effects.},
