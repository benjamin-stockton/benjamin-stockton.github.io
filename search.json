    "text": "In this post, I will provide a brief introduction to using multiple imputation (MI) and then share an example analysis of pitch movement using my imputeangles package.\nMost statistical analysis methods are designed with complete data in mind, however, real-world data is often incomplete with observations missing due to nonresponse, censoring, or measurement issues. The incomplete data cannot be directly analyzed with the complete data statistical methods. While there are specialized methods designed to model incomplete data, due to the convenience and wide availability of complete data methods it would be highly beneficial to complete the incomplete data. This could be accomplished by removing incomplete cases and performing complete case analysis (CCA), but this could throw out lots of useful data (Joseph L. Schafer and Graham 2002)."

    "section": "Multiple Imputation",
    "text": "Multiple Imputation\nImputation is the process of replacing the missing values with values deterministically calculated by the observed data or with values drawn from a probability distribution shaped by the observed data. Two common, but not theoretically valid, ways to do this are mean imputation (replace with the sample mean or regression predicted values) (Joseph L. Schafer 1999) or last observation carried forward (LOCF) for time series or longitudinal data (Moritz et al. 2022). These methods are performed a single time to create a singly imputed (SI) data set. Alternatively, we could impute the missing values with random draws from the observed data or from a predictive distribution based on the observed data. These imputations are worse in terms of providing accurate predictions for the missing value, however, they do reflect the uncertainty of the missing value. Repeatedly imputing the missing values to create multiple imputed data sets can propagate the uncertainty to the analysis.\nThis process is called by Multiple Imputation (MI) and was initially developed by Donald Rubin in the 1970s and 1980s for nonresponse in surveys Rubin (1987), and then extended to more analysis contexts since the 1990s Harel (2009). The foundation of MI is a three stage process.\n\nImpute - Fill in the missing values with random samples from a predictive distribution (posterior predictive draws theoretically preferred) to create \\(M\\) completed data sets.\nAnalyze - Analyze each of the \\(M\\) data sets with a complete data method to estimate a quantity of interest \\(Q\\) using estimate \\(\\hat{Q}_m\\) and its squared standard error \\(U_m = SE(\\hat{Q})^2\\).\nCombine - Use Rubin’s Rules to combine the estimates and variances to perform inference on the quantity of interest \\(Q\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\label{eq-rubins-rules}\n    \\bar{Q} &= \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^M \\hat{Q}_m \\\\\n    \\bar{U} &= \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{m=1}^M U_m \\\\\n    B &= \\frac{1}{M-1} \\sum_{m=1}^M (\\hat{Q}_m - \\bar{Q})^2 \\\\\n    T &= \\bar{U} + (1 + \\frac{1}{M}) B\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nUnder a set of assumptions1, the inferences produced by MI will be unbiased, more efficient than CCA, and confidence valid. Rubin’s rules have been developed for sample means, sample mean differences, regression coefficients, correlation coefficients, and more (Stef van Buuren 2018, sec. 5.2)."

    "text": "Pitch Movement\nIn baseball, highly-skilled pitchers are able to impart different rates and axis of spin on the pitched ball resulting in varying movements (or lack thereof) on the pitch as it travels to the catcher. Modeling these characteristics has been a central development to coaching pitchers in the past decade2. In the following illustrative analysis, we’ll use pitch-level data collected by MLB to predict whether a non-batted pitch will be swung at and missed."

The inline data will be imputed by method = \"pmm\" which uses predictive mean matching. The angular data, spin rate, will be imputed by method = \"pnregid\" which uses Bayesian projected normal regression with a constrained covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\) (Hernandez-Stumpfhauser, Breidt, and Woerd 2017) from my imputeangles package.\nTo impute with the projected normal regression, we have to specify to mice which variable is angular and which variables are the \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\sin\\) of the angular variable. We can do this by doing an empty run of mice() by setting the maximum number of cycles to 0.

This makes sense for Miley since he tries to get weak contact (very effectively with a the lowest hard hit rate in MLB for SP at 31.1%, but a less stellar FIP of 4.69). In Burnes case, this may be a result of his pitches having a lot of movement resulting in more balls, and worked relatively well (FIP of 3.81 on the year, but 3.07 BB/9). Freddy Peralta and Colin Rea live in the zone with all or most of their pitch types being thrown for strikes on average. This worked well for Freddy in 2023, particularly in the second half of 2023 when he had a FIP of 2.92 (9th out of starters), and less well for Rea who had a FIP of 4.90 on the year.

    "section": "A Very Brief Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis",
    "text": "A Very Brief Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis\nThe broadest conceptual overview of Bayesian data analysis is that this methodology allows us to incorporate prior knowledge about the model/data into our analysis which is based on a posterior distribution that is derived from the prior and likelihood. Bayesian inference treats the parameters of the model as random variables whose distribution we are interested in either deriving analytically or approximating through computation. This is a key distinction from frequentist methods taught in math stat and applied stat where parameters are fixed values and their estimators are functions of a random sample and the sampling distribution of the estimator is used for inference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBayes Rule\n\n\n\nA quick reminder of Bayes Rule.\nLet \\(\\theta\\) be a random variable with (prior) distribution \\(p(\\theta)\\), \\(Y\\) be a random variable that depends on \\(\\theta\\) with conditional distribution or likelihood \\(p(y | \\theta)\\). Then their joint distribution is \\(p(y, \\theta) = p(y|\\theta) p(\\theta)\\).\nBayes rule lets us flip the conditioning from the likelihood to get \\(p(\\theta | y)\\)\n\\[\np(\\theta | y) = \\frac{p(y, \\theta)}{p(y)} = \\frac{p(y|\\theta) p(\\theta)}{\\int p(y, \\theta) d\\theta} \\propto p(y|\\theta) p(\\theta)\n\\]\n\n\nTo be a little more specific, we have three central components to the model. For ease of exposition, let’s consider the simple regression model \\(E(Y_i | X_i = x_i, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i\\) and \\(Var(Y_i | X_i = x_i, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\sigma^2\\) where we have \\(i = 1,\\dots,N\\) observations of \\((Y_i, X_i)'\\) from Ch. 14 of Bayesian Data Analysis (Gelman et al. 2013, 354–58). From here on I will suppress conditioning on the observed predictor \\(X_i = x_i\\) since we are considering the design matrix \\(X = (1_N, \\mathbf{x})\\) to be fixed and known where \\(\\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\\dots, x_N)'\\).\n\nThe Prior: a distribution for the parameters that doesn’t depend on the data \\(p(\\theta)\\).\nThe (Data) Likelihood: a model for the data that depends on the parameters \\(p(y | \\theta)\\).\nThe Posterior: a distribution that uses Bayes rule to define distribution of the parameters given the data \\(p(\\theta|y)\\)."

In this case, I will use 1000 warmup iterations, 1000 sampling iterations, with no thinning (thinning includes only every \\(k\\)th draw), and will refresh the print screen to see progress every 500 iterations.

First, we will look at the numeric diagnostic output from the method $diagnostic_summary() which reports if any transitions were divergent, if maximum tree depth was reached, and EBFMI. For this model and data set we don’t see any issues in these summaries.\nNext, we check the traceplots in Figure 3 (a). The MCMC draws can be collected from the fit object using the $draws() method. These plots display the sampled values for each parameter in a line plot. We are looking for a horizontal fuzzy bar. Then we can also look at density plots in Figure 3 (b) which will tell us if the chains reached reasonably similar densities. On both counts, we are in good shape. The plots are created using the bayesplot package.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nfit1$diagnostic_summary()\n\n\n\n$num_divergent\n[1] 0 0\n\n$num_max_treedepth\n[1] 0 0\n\n$ebfmi\n[1] 1.158355 1.007918\n\n\n\nThis is bayesplot version 1.10.0\n\n\n- Online documentation and vignettes at mc-stan.org/bayesplot\n\n\n- bayesplot theme set to bayesplot::theme_default()\n\n\n   * Does _not_ affect other ggplot2 plots\n\n\n   * See ?bayesplot_theme_set for details on theme setting\n\n\nCode\nmcmc_trace(fit1$draws(variables = c(\"beta\", \"sigma\")))\n\nmcmc_dens_overlay(fit1$draws(variables = c(\"beta\", \"sigma\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nlibrary(bayesplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Traceplots for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Approximate posterior densities for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Diagnostic plots for the posterior samples. Plots were made using the bayesplot package.\n\n\n\nFinally, after checking that the MCMC chains and diagnostics look satisfactory, we can continue to inference. The summary statistics for the parameters are displayed in Table 1. This are generated by default with the $summary() method. The statistics include the posterior mean (mean), median (median), standard deviation (sd), mean absolute deviation (mad), and lower (q5) and upper bounds (q95) for a 90% credible interval. The statistics rhat, ess_bulk, and ess_tail are additional diagnostic measures that indicate how well the chains are sampling the posterior and how many effective draws we have made. Ideally rhat is very near 1, even 1.01 can be a significant problem. The effective sample sizes should be large/near the number of sampling iterations.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nfit1$summary(variables = c(\"beta\", \"sigma\")) |&gt; \n    kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, format = \"html\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary statistics for the posterior samples for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nmean\nmedian\nsd\nmad\nq5\nq95\nrhat\ness_bulk\ness_tail\n\n\n\n\nbeta[1]\n-15.170201\n-15.17435\n2.7264741\n2.6386574\n-19.6968650\n-10.670060\n1.003857\n600.4229\n668.3881\n\n\nbeta[2]\n1.016536\n1.01743\n0.0876394\n0.0866691\n0.8718595\n1.159618\n1.004031\n596.0433\n630.5212\n\n\nsigma\n5.927539\n5.92005\n0.2185852\n0.2262596\n5.5846900\n6.297106\n1.001305\n862.2062\n822.5273\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nmles |&gt; \n    kableExtra::kbl(booktabs = TRUE, \n                    format = \"html\", digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: MLE estimates for \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameters\nEstimates\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\nbeta_0\n-14.945\n\n\nFG3pct\nbeta_1\n1.009\n\n\n\nsigma\n5.908\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also check graphical summaries of this same information such as interval plots for each parameter’s credible intervals or density/area plots.

Plots were made using the bayesplot package.\n\n\n\nOne additional way to check model fit is to assess posterior predictive checks. To do so we draw samples from the posterior predictive distribution \\(p(y^{new} | y) = \\int p(y^{new} | \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma) p(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma | y) d\\boldsymbol{\\beta}d\\sigma\\) by first sampling from the posterior (i.e. the draws in the MCMC chains) and then for each set of draws sampling \\(y^{new}\\) given the corresponding values for \\(x^{new}\\). In Stan this is easily accomplished using the generated quantities block. The generated quantities block generates new samples that we define using the current iteration’s posterior draws of \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\sigma\\).\ngenerated quantities {\n    // create a vector of N new observations\n    vector[N] y_ppd; \n    \n    // for each observation, sample from the regression likelihod\n    // using the posterior draws\n    for (i in 1:N) {\n        y_ppd[i] = normal_rng(X_c[i,] * beta, sigma);\n    }\n}\nWe collect the PPD draws from the fit object using the draws method. From Figure 5 we can see that while the predictive densities are centered in the correct location, the variances are far too large.\n\nThis is posterior version 1.5.0\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'posterior'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:bayesplot':\n\n    rhat\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    mad, sd, var\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    %in%, match\n\n\nCode\ny_ppd &lt;- as.matrix(as_draws_df(fit1$draws(variables = \"y_ppd\")))\n\nppc_dens_overlay(ncaaw$W,\n                 y_ppd[1:50, 1:350]) +\n    labs(title = \"Density of PPD Draws of NCAAW Wins\",\n         x = \"Wins\")\n\nppc_intervals(ncaaw$W,\n                 y_ppd[1:50, 1:350],\n                 x = ncaaw$FG3pct) +\n    labs(title = \"Density of PPD Draws of NCAAW Wins by 3pt%\",\n         x = \"3pt%\",\n         y = \"Wins\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nlibrary(posterior)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) PPD densities for the wins given 3pt%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) PPD intervals for the wins plotted by 3pt%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Posterior Predictive Check plots from bayesplot.\n\n\n\n\n\nConjugate Prior Regression Model\nNext, we’ll implement the regression model with conjugate priors. Conjugacy refers to the situation where the prior and posterior distribution are from the same family. We’ll start by re-defining our model.1\n\nConjugate prior: \\(p(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = p(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} | \\sigma^2) p(\\sigma^2)\\)\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} | \\sigma^2 ~ N_2(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0, \\sigma^2 \\Lambda_0^{-1})\\) where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^2\\) is a vector of prior coefficients, we’ll set it to zero, and \\(\\Lambda_0\\) is a \\(2\\times2\\) prior correlation matrix. We will set \\(\\Lambda_0 = 10 I_2\\) to get a weakly informative prior that is equivalent to ridge regression.\n\\(\\sigma^2 \\sim InvGamma(\\frac{\\nu_0}{2}, \\frac{1}{2} \\nu_0 s_0^2)\\) where \\(\\nu_0\\) is a prior sample size and \\(s_0\\) is the prior standard deviation. We’ll set these to \\(\\nu_0 = 1\\) and \\(s_0^2 = 47\\) which is approximately the sample variance of the NCAA women’s basketball teams’ wins.\nThe parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0, \\Lambda_0, \\nu_0, s_0^2\\) that define the prior are referred to as hyperparameters. We will set them before running the model, although they could also be modeled if we wanted.\n\nThe (Data) Likelihood: the same as before, \\(\\mathbf{Y} | \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2 \\sim N_N(X\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2 I_N).\\)\nPosterior:\n\n\\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} | \\sigma^2, y \\sim N_2(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_N, \\sigma^2 \\Lambda_N^{-1})\\) where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_N = \\Lambda_N^{-1}(\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} + \\Lambda_0 \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0)\\) and \\(\\Lambda_N = (\\mathbf{X}'\\mathbf{X} + \\Lambda_0).\\)\n\\(\\sigma^2 | y \\sim InvGamma(\\sigma^2 | \\frac{\\nu_0 + N}{2}, \\frac{1}{2} \\nu_0 s_0^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{y}'\\mathbf{y} + \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0'\\Lambda_0 \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_0 - \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_N' \\Lambda_N \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_N)).\\)\n\n\nWe could again program this model using the analytic posterior. Instead, we’ll program it only through the priors and likelihood and let Stan approximate the posterior. I will also allow the model to include more than one predictor so that \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a \\(N \\times (K+1)\\) matrix augmented with a column of ones.

    "text": "Bonus: Regression Modeling with Incomplete Data\nAs a bonus section, we’ll use the brms package to fit a regression model where we have incomplete predictor observations. Incomplete data analysis ranges from complete case analysis (incomplete cases are dropped) and mean imputation to multiple imputation, joint modeling, and EM algorithm (Schafer and Graham 2002).2 We’re going to use mice (Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn 2010) and brms (Bürkner 2018) to demonstrate the imputation and fitting Bayesian regression models with a convenient front-end that writes the Stan code for us.\nIn our case, we are going to use junior year scoring (points per game) to predict senior year scoring for women’s college basketball players from 2020-21 to the 2022-23 seasons. The data set only contains players who played in at least 75% of games each season, so partial seasons due to injury or being a bench player are excluded. Players who only have a junior season are excluded from the analysis.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nncaaw_i &lt;- read.csv(\"Data/ncaaw-individuals.csv\", header = TRUE)\nhead(ncaaw_i)\n\n\n\n             Name Pos_jr Pos_sr G_jr G_sr PPG_jr PPG_sr Cl_jr\n1     A'Jah Davis      F      F   29   32   16.6   16.2   Jr.\n2 Abby Brockmeyer      F      F   NA   31     NA   16.3   Jr.\n3       Abby Feit      F      F   29   28   15.1   15.5   Jr.\n4     Abby Meyers      G      G   NA   30     NA   17.9   Jr.\n5     Abby Meyers      G      G   NA   35     NA   14.3   Jr.\n6   Adriana Shipp      G      G   NA   30     NA   13.9   Jr.\n\n\nOur imputation model will be univariate linear regression that use all other variables as predictors. For example, imputing \\(PPG_{jr}\\) will be done by regressing on \\(PPG_{sr}, G_{jr}, G_{sr}\\). \\(PPG_{jr}\\) and \\(G_{jr}\\) are incomplete for \\(n_{mis} = 176\\) players while \\(n_{obs} = 98\\) players have stats from both years.

MICE stands for Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations and is procedure that creates a set of \\(M\\) completed data sets from an incomplete data set. Multiple Imputation is a three stage procedure:\n\nEach incomplete variable is imputed with posterior predictive draws from a regression model with all other variables as predictors. The procedure iterates through the incomplete variables several times to converge to the posterior predictive distribution of the missing data given the observed.\nThese completed data sets are then analyzed individually with a standard complete data method.\nResults from each analysis are combined. Typically this is done with Rubin’s rules (Rubin 1987), but brms follows the advice of Zhou and Reiter (2010) and simply stacks the posterior draw matrices from each fitted model.\n\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nlibrary(brms)\n\nimps &lt;- mice(ncaaw_i, m = 10, method = \"norm\", maxit = 10, printFlag = FALSE)\n\nfit_brm_mice &lt;- brm_multiple(PPG_sr ~ G_jr * PPG_jr, data = imps, chains = 2,\n                             refresh = 0)\nsummary(fit_brm_mice)\n\n\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: PPG_sr ~ G_jr * PPG_jr \n   Data: imps (Number of observations: 274) \n  Draws: 20 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 20000\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n            Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept      18.23      6.45     5.81    31.16 1.49       37      106\nG_jr           -0.26      0.25    -0.77     0.23 1.51       36       94\nPPG_jr         -0.12      0.39    -0.89     0.62 1.55       35      110\nG_jr:PPG_jr     0.02      0.02    -0.01     0.05 1.57       34       94\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     2.21      0.10     2.01     2.42 1.11      118      372\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

Imputations are made for each incomplete variable using a different conditional model for each variable. This approach differs from MI and MICE in two key ways: (i) the model is only fit once since the imputation model is part of the analysis model, (ii) the model must be constructed uniquely for each analysis scenario whereas MI completed data sets can be re-used with different analyses.\n\n\n\nCode\n\nintro-to-stan.R\n\nbform &lt;- bf(PPG_sr | mi() ~ mi(G_jr) * mi(PPG_jr)) +\n    bf(PPG_jr | mi() ~ G_sr + PPG_sr) +\n    bf(G_jr | mi() ~ G_sr + PPG_sr) + set_rescor(FALSE)\n\nfit_brm_mi &lt;- brm(bform, data = ncaaw_i, \n                  refresh = 500, iter = 2000, thin = 1,\n                  backend = \"cmdstanr\", \n                  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.8, \n                                 max_depth = 10,\n                                show_exceptions = FALSE),\n                  chains = 2,\n                  cores = 2)\n\nsummary(fit_brm_mi)\n\n\n\n Family: MV(gaussian, gaussian, gaussian) \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity\n         mu = identity; sigma = identity\n         mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: PPG_sr | mi() ~ mi(G_jr) * mi(PPG_jr) \n         PPG_jr | mi() ~ G_sr + PPG_sr \n         G_jr | mi() ~ G_sr + PPG_sr \n   Data: ncaaw_i (Number of observations: 274) \n  Draws: 2 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 2000\n\nPopulation-Level Effects: \n                      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS\nPPGsr_Intercept          16.10      2.29    11.60    20.74 1.00      615\nPPGjr_Intercept           5.95      2.33     1.14    10.46 1.00      900\nGjr_Intercept             2.98      6.31    -9.27    15.38 1.00      789\nPPGjr_G_sr               -0.04      0.06    -0.17     0.09 1.00     1053\nPPGjr_PPG_sr              0.72      0.08     0.56     0.89 1.00      732\nGjr_G_sr                  0.56      0.18     0.19     0.90 1.00      807\nGjr_PPG_sr                0.28      0.23    -0.16     0.72 1.00      622\nPPGsr_miG_jr             -0.30      0.09    -0.48    -0.12 1.00      565\nPPGsr_miPPG_jr           -0.04      0.15    -0.32     0.26 1.00      591\nPPGsr_miG_jr:miPPG_jr     0.02      0.01     0.01     0.03 1.00      544\n                      Tail_ESS\nPPGsr_Intercept            631\nPPGjr_Intercept           1221\nGjr_Intercept             1290\nPPGjr_G_sr                1244\nPPGjr_PPG_sr              1345\nGjr_G_sr                  1182\nGjr_PPG_sr                 874\nPPGsr_miG_jr               589\nPPGsr_miPPG_jr             736\nPPGsr_miG_jr:miPPG_jr      605\n\nFamily Specific Parameters: \n            Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma_PPGsr     1.86      0.09     1.70     2.04 1.00     1706     1355\nsigma_PPGjr     2.31      0.15     2.04     2.63 1.00      634     1066\nsigma_Gjr       5.33      0.38     4.66     6.15 1.00      650     1214\n\nDraws were sampled using sample(hmc).
