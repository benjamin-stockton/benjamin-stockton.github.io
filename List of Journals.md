## General Journals

-  JASA
	- "Articles focus on statistical applications, theory, and methods throughout all disciplines that make use of data, including economic, social, biological, physical, engineering, and health sciences and the humanities."
	- Would be under "Theory and Methods"; "Theory and Methods section publishes articles that make original contributions to the foundations, theoretical development, and **methodology of statistics** and probability"
		- "Authors are reminded that the _Journal of the American Statistical Association_ is the flagship publication of the American Statistical Association. As such, it seeks to publish substantive articles that are likely to have broad impact on theory, methodology, and practice of statistical science. For this reason, shorter contributions or more narrowly focused contributions, while of considerable merit in their own right, may be inappropriate for the Theory and Methods."
- [New England Journal of Statistics in Data Science](https://journal.nestat.org/about)
	- The aims of the journal are to serve as an interface between statistics and other disciplines in data science, to encourage researchers to exchange innovative ideas, and to promote data science methods to the general scientific community. The journal publishes high quality original research, novel applications, and timely review articles in all aspects of data science, including (but not limited to) all areas of statistical methodology, methods of machine learning, and artificial intelligence, novel algorithms, computational methods, data management and manipulation, applications of data science methods, among others. We encourage authors to submit collaborative work driven by real life problems posed by researchers, administrators, educators, or other stakeholders, and which require original and innovative solutions from data scientists.
- [Bayesian Analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/scope-and-details)
	- _Bayesian Analysis_ is an electronic journal of the [International Society for Bayesian Analysis](https://bayesian.org/). It seeks to publish a wide range of articles that demonstrate or discuss Bayesian methods in some theoretical or applied context. The journal welcomes submissions involving presentation of new computational and statistical methods; critical reviews and discussions of existing approaches; historical perspectives; description of important scientific or policy application areas; case studies; and methods for experimental design, data collection, data sharing, or data mining.
- [Statistics Sinica](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/)
	- _Statistica Sinica_ aims to meet the needs of statisticians and data scientists in a rapidly changing world. It provides a forum for publishing innovative work of high quality in all areas of statistics and data science, including theory, methodology, and applications. The journal encourages the development and principled use of statistical methodologies relevant to society, science, and technology.
- [Journal of Time Series Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679892)
	- During the last 30 years Time Series Analysis has become one of the most important and widely used branches of Mathematical Statistics. Its fields of application range from neurophysiology to astrophysics and it covers such well-known areas as economic forecasting, study of biological data, control systems, signal processing and communications and vibrations engineering.
	- The _Journal of Time Series Analysis_ started in 1980, has since become the leading journal in its field, publishing papers on both fundamental theory and applications, as well as review papers dealing with recent advances in major areas of the subject and short communications on theoretical developments. The editorial board consists of many of the world's leading experts in Time Series Analysis.

## Theoretical/Methodology-focused Journals

- JRSS Series B
	- "The objective of papers should be to contribute to the understanding of statistical methodology and/or to develop and improve statistical methods; any mathematical theory should be directed towards these aims...Also considered are comparisons, critical evaluations and new applications of existing methods, ..., statistical computation or simulation where original methodology is involved and original contributions to the foundations of statistical science."
	- "A paper, even if correct and well presented, is likely to be rejected if it only presents straightforward special cases of previously published work, if it is of mathematical interest only, if it is too long in relation to the importance of the new material that it contains or if **it is dominated by computations or simulations of a routine nature.**"
- Biometrika
	- "emphasis is placed on papers containing original theoretical contributions of direct or potential value in applications"
- [Journal of Multivariate Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-multivariate-analysis/about/aims-and-scope)
	- The journal welcomes contributions to all aspects of multivariate data analysis and modeling, including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, factor analysis, and multidimensional continuous or discrete distribution theory.
	- Papers making substantial contributions to regression or time series analysis for multidimensional response variables are also invited. Submissions dealing with univariate models, including regression models with a single response variable and univariate time series models, are deemed to fall outside the journal's remit.
- [Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-statistical-planning-and-inference)
	- The _Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference_ offers itself as a multifaceted and all-inclusive bridge between classical aspects of **statistics** and **probability**, and the emerging interdisciplinary aspects that have a potential of revolutionizing the subject. While we maintain our traditional strength in **statistical inference**, design, classical probability, and large sample methods, we also have a far more inclusive and broadened scope to keep up with the new problems that confront us as statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists, such as clustering, post model selection inference, deep learning and random networks

## Applied Journals

- [Sankhya B](https://www.springer.com/journal/13571)
	- **Sankhya, Series B**, primarily covers applied and interdisciplinary statistics including data sciences. Applied articles should preferably include analysis of original data of broad interest, novel applications of methodology and development of methods and techniques of immediate practical use. The Journal also welcomes submissions that expose potential applications to finance, insurance, economics, biology, physics, and general engineering & technology. Authoritative reviews and comprehensive discussion articles in areas of vigorous current research are also welcome.
- [Journal of Applied Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=cjas20)
	- **_Journal of Applied Statistics_** is a world-leading journal which provides a forum for communication among statisticians and practitioners for judicious application of statistical principles and innovations of statistical methodology motivated by current and important real-world examples across a wide range of disciplines
	- The editorial policy is to publish rigorous, clear and accessible papers on methods developed for real-life statistical problems, and which are anticipated to have a broad scientific impact. Purely theoretical papers are avoided but those on theoretical developments which clearly exhibit concrete applied potential may be considered. Papers demonstrating creative development of statistical techniques based on a true challenge in a subject area are strongly encouraged. The Journal publishes original research papers, review articles, and short application notes.
	- In general, **original research papers** should present one or two challenges in an area, include relevant data, provide a novel method to solve challenges, and demonstrate that the proposed method has answered questions that were not properly or optimally addressed before by relevant existing methods.
- JABES
	- "papers that **introduce new statistical methods to solve practical problems in the agricultural sciences, the biological sciences (including biotechnology), and the environmental sciences** (including those dealing with natural resources)...The journal **does not normally publish papers that have a primary focus on human genetics, human health**, or medical statistics."
- [Annals of Statistics](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-statistics/annals-of-statistics-editorial-policy/)
	- "Primary emphasis is placed on importance and originality, not on formalism. The journal aims to cover all areas of statistics, especially mathematical statistics and applied & interdisciplinary statistics."
- Annals of Applied Statistics
	- "We hope to publish papers that have substantive applied origins and involve relevant datasets, while also being of interest beyond the specific application. Papers that include innovative methodology brought to bear on scientific/policy questions and relevant data are especially welcome. Typically, a paper will be framed around one or more unresolved applied problems, where data are introduced to help address them. Data analyses should go well beyond numerical illustrations of calculations of proposed new methodology, with particular emphasis put on comparative analyses and substantive findings."

## Software and Computation Journals

- Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics
	- "The **_Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics_** (**_JCGS_**) presents the very latest techniques on improving and extending the use of computational and graphical methods in statistics and data analysis. Established in 1992, this journal contains cutting-edge research, data, surveys, and more on numerical graphical displays and methods, and perception. Articles are written for readers who have a strong background in statistics but are not necessarily experts in computing."
- [Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/gscs20/current)
	- **Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation** (JSCS) publishes significant and original work in areas of statistics which are related to or dependent upon computation or simulation.
