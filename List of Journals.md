[List of ASA journals](https://www.amstat.org/publications/journals)
## General Journals

-  [JASA](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uasa20)
	- "Articles focus on statistical applications, theory, and methods throughout all disciplines that make use of data, including economic, social, biological, physical, engineering, and health sciences and the humanities."
	- Would be under "Theory and Methods"; "Theory and Methods section publishes articles that make original contributions to the foundations, theoretical development, and **methodology of statistics** and probability"
		- "Authors are reminded that the _Journal of the American Statistical Association_ is the flagship publication of the American Statistical Association. As such, it seeks to publish substantive articles that are likely to have broad impact on theory, methodology, and practice of statistical science. For this reason, shorter contributions or more narrowly focused contributions, while of considerable merit in their own right, may be inappropriate for the Theory and Methods."
- [New England Journal of Statistics in Data Science](https://journal.nestat.org/about)
	- The aims of the journal are to serve as an interface between statistics and other disciplines in data science, to encourage researchers to exchange innovative ideas, and to promote data science methods to the general scientific community. The journal publishes high quality original research, novel applications, and timely review articles in all aspects of data science, including (but not limited to) all areas of statistical methodology, methods of machine learning, and artificial intelligence, novel algorithms, computational methods, data management and manipulation, applications of data science methods, among others. We encourage authors to submit collaborative work driven by real life problems posed by researchers, administrators, educators, or other stakeholders, and which require original and innovative solutions from data scientists.
- [Bayesian Analysis](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/scope-and-details)
	- _Bayesian Analysis_ is an electronic journal of the [International Society for Bayesian Analysis](https://bayesian.org/). It seeks to publish a wide range of articles that demonstrate or discuss Bayesian methods in some theoretical or applied context. The journal welcomes submissions involving presentation of new computational and statistical methods; critical reviews and discussions of existing approaches; historical perspectives; description of important scientific or policy application areas; case studies; and methods for experimental design, data collection, data sharing, or data mining.
- [Statistics Sinica](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/)
	- _Statistica Sinica_ aims to meet the needs of statisticians and data scientists in a rapidly changing world. It provides a forum for publishing innovative work of high quality in all areas of statistics and data science, including theory, methodology, and applications. The journal encourages the development and principled use of statistical methodologies relevant to society, science, and technology.
- [Journal of Time Series Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14679892)
	- During the last 30 years Time Series Analysis has become one of the most important and widely used branches of Mathematical Statistics. Its fields of application range from neurophysiology to astrophysics and it covers such well-known areas as economic forecasting, study of biological data, control systems, signal processing and communications and vibrations engineering.
	- The _Journal of Time Series Analysis_ started in 1980, has since become the leading journal in its field, publishing papers on both fundamental theory and applications, as well as review papers dealing with recent advances in major areas of the subject and short communications on theoretical developments. The editorial board consists of many of the world's leading experts in Time Series Analysis.
- [Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A Statistics in Society (JRSS: Series A)](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssa/pages/about)
	- _Series A_ looks at how innovative statistical thinking, design, methods, and analyses play a vital role in all walks of life and benefit society. For example, medicine and biomedical sciences, business and commerce, industry, economics and finance, education and teaching, the law, government and politics, demography, psychology, sociology and sport all fall within its remit.
	- The journal’s emphasis is on clearly written quantitative approaches to problems of current relevance rather than the exposition of technical detail. Of particular interest are papers on topical or contentious statistical issues that give reviews or exposés of current statistical concerns, and papers that contribute to our understanding of important substantive questions. Historical, professional, and biographical contributions are also published, as are discussions of methods of data collection and of ethical issues.
- [ASA Discoveries](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/uasd20/about-this-journal)
	- The ASA and Taylor & Francis are currently supporting a 100% APC discount for all authors.   
	- **_ASA Discoveries_** is an open access journal for the dissemination of high-quality research and critical reviews across the interconnected domains of statistics, data science, and artificial intelligence (AI). The journal publishes high-quality papers encompassing advances in both theory and practice, promoting statistical and machine learning methodologies, statistical computing, data visualization, data-driven insights, and AI innovations. The journal publishes on a rolling basis. As articles are published, they will be added immediately to the main annual volume and can thus immediately be cited.   
	- **Aims**  
		- Innovative Theory and Methods:   
		    Publish original research articles that advance theoretical knowledge or present novel methodologies, algorithms, and models in statistics, data science, and AI.

- [Spatial Statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/spatial-statistics/about/aims-and-scope)
	- **_Spatial Statistics_** publishes articles on the theory and application of spatial and spatio-temporal statistics. It favours manuscripts that present theory generated by new applications, or in which new theory is applied to an important practical case. A purely theoretical study will only rarely be accepted. Pure case studies and algorithms without methodological development are not acceptable for publication.
	- **_Spatial Statistics_** concerns the quantitative analysis of spatial and spatio-temporal data, including their statistical dependencies, heterogeneity, accuracy and uncertainties. Methodology for spatial statistics is typically found in probability theory, stochastic modelling and mathematical statistics as well as in information and computer science. Spatial statistics is used in mapping, assessing spatial data quality, sampling design optimisation, modelling of spatial structures, and drawing of valid inference and causality from a limited set of spatio-temporal data. Application fields include:
		- The physical domains, e.g. environment, climate, agriculture, ecology, geosciences oceanography and remote sensing.   
		- The social/economic domains, e.g. epidemiology, population characteristics, and disease mapping.
- [Journal of Data Science](https://jds-online.org/journal/JDS/information/focus-and-scope)
	- Established in 2003, the _Journal of Data Science_ aims to advance and promote data science methods, computing, and applications in all scientific fields where knowledge and insights are to be extracted from data. The journal publishes research works on the full spectrum of data science including statistics, computer science, and domain applications. The topics can be about any aspect of the life cycle (collecting, processing, analyzing, communicating, etc.) of data science projects from any field that involves understanding and making effective use of data. The emphasis is on applications, case studies, statistical methods, computational tools, and reviews of data science.
- [Journal of Nonparametric Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/gnst20)

	- Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary technical arguments, computer code, data analysed in the paper or any additional information for online publication along with the published paper.

## Theoretical/Methodology-focused Journals

- [Journal of the Royal Statistics Society (JRSS Series B)](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb)
	- "The objective of papers should be to contribute to the understanding of statistical methodology and/or to develop and improve statistical methods; any mathematical theory should be directed towards these aims...Also considered are comparisons, critical evaluations and new applications of existing methods, ..., statistical computation or simulation where original methodology is involved and original contributions to the foundations of statistical science."
	- "A paper, even if correct and well presented, is likely to be rejected if it only presents straightforward special cases of previously published work, if it is of mathematical interest only, if it is too long in relation to the importance of the new material that it contains or if **it is dominated by computations or simulations of a routine nature.**"
- [Journal of Multivariate Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-multivariate-analysis/about/aims-and-scope)
	- The journal welcomes contributions to all aspects of multivariate data analysis and modeling, including cluster analysis, discriminant analysis, factor analysis, and multidimensional continuous or discrete distribution theory.
	- Papers making substantial contributions to regression or time series analysis for multidimensional response variables are also invited. Submissions dealing with univariate models, including regression models with a single response variable and univariate time series models, are deemed to fall outside the journal's remit.
- [Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-statistical-planning-and-inference)
	- The _Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference_ offers itself as a multifaceted and all-inclusive bridge between classical aspects of **statistics** and **probability**, and the emerging interdisciplinary aspects that have a potential of revolutionizing the subject. While we maintain our traditional strength in **statistical inference**, design, classical probability, and large sample methods, we also have a far more inclusive and broadened scope to keep up with the new problems that confront us as statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists, such as clustering, post model selection inference, deep learning and random networks
- [Annals of Statistics](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-statistics/annals-of-statistics-editorial-policy/)
	- "Primary emphasis is placed on importance and originality, not on formalism. The journal aims to cover all areas of statistics, especially mathematical statistics and applied & interdisciplinary statistics."
- [Biometrika](https://academic.oup.com/biomet)
	- There are no restrictions on the area of statistics considered by _Biometrika_. The three primary criteria by which all papers are judged are:
		1. importance of the work to the understanding, practice or potential practice of statistics;
		2. the degree of conceptual novelty and insight;
		3. the conciseness and clarity with which the ideas are conveyed.
	- The novelty may take many forms, including: the development of new methodology accompanied by an insightful analysis; papers where the innovation is around computational efficiency, where this is important for the application of the statistical method; a penetrating exposition of anomalous or unforeseen behaviour of mainstream inferential tools; original formulations uncovering foundational structure with potential relevance to statistical practice. Papers concerned purely with sampling properties of existing procedures or minor developments thereof are typically unsuitable unless such properties reveal considerable structural understanding. We do not publish purely applied work.
	- _Biometrika_ publishes three types of paper: regular papers, synthesis papers (both normally fewer than 20 pages) and miscellanea articles (max. 8 pages). Miscellanea papers are not expected to have the breadth of contribution of regular papers but need to meet the same standards in terms of importance of the work, novelty of the insights, and general quality. Synthesis papers should either open up an emerging area outside of statistics to a statistical audience, assuming that area will be important to statistics, or be a synthesis of two or more areas of statistics that brings fundamental new insight.

## Applied Journals

- [Sankhya B](https://www.springer.com/journal/13571)
	- **Sankhya, Series B**, primarily covers applied and interdisciplinary statistics including data sciences. Applied articles should preferably include analysis of original data of broad interest, novel applications of methodology and development of methods and techniques of immediate practical use. The Journal also welcomes submissions that expose potential applications to finance, insurance, economics, biology, physics, and general engineering & technology. Authoritative reviews and comprehensive discussion articles in areas of vigorous current research are also welcome.
- [Journal of Applied Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&journalCode=cjas20)
	- **_Journal of Applied Statistics_** is a world-leading journal which provides a forum for communication among statisticians and practitioners for judicious application of statistical principles and innovations of statistical methodology motivated by current and important real-world examples across a wide range of disciplines
	- The editorial policy is to publish rigorous, clear and accessible papers on methods developed for real-life statistical problems, and which are anticipated to have a broad scientific impact. Purely theoretical papers are avoided but those on theoretical developments which clearly exhibit concrete applied potential may be considered. Papers demonstrating creative development of statistical techniques based on a true challenge in a subject area are strongly encouraged. The Journal publishes original research papers, review articles, and short application notes.
	- In general, **original research papers** should present one or two challenges in an area, include relevant data, provide a novel method to solve challenges, and demonstrate that the proposed method has answered questions that were not properly or optimally addressed before by relevant existing methods.
- [Journal of Agricultural, Biological, and Environmental Statistics (JABES)](https://link.springer.com/journal/13253)
	- "papers that **introduce new statistical methods to solve practical problems in the agricultural sciences, the biological sciences (including biotechnology), and the environmental sciences** (including those dealing with natural resources)...The journal **does not normally publish papers that have a primary focus on human genetics, human health**, or medical statistics."
- [Annals of Applied Statistics](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/annals-of-applied-statistics/)
	- "We hope to publish papers that have substantive applied origins and involve relevant datasets, while also being of interest beyond the specific application. Papers that include innovative methodology brought to bear on scientific/policy questions and relevant data are especially welcome. Typically, a paper will be framed around one or more unresolved applied problems, where data are introduced to help address them. Data analyses should go well beyond numerical illustrations of calculations of proposed new methodology, with particular emphasis put on comparative analyses and substantive findings."
- [Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (JRSS Series C)](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssc/pages/about)
	- _Series C_ seeks to publish papers that are tackling genuine problems in applied statistics, i.e. where applications are central to the paper and provide the motivation for the work presented. This usually implies that the specific application under study will also be mentioned in the title, and should figure prominently in abstract, introduction and discussion as well as in other parts of the paper. In essence, papers should directly engage with the application and should clearly indicate what additional insights into the applied problem have been gained by applying the suggested methodology. This also implies that some technical details, derivations and proofs might not form part of the main body of the text, but might be moved into supplementary material.  
	- _Series C_ papers make a novel contribution to statistics by adapting or developing new statistical methodology for a specific applied context, or by demonstrating the innovative combination of existing advanced statistical methods. JRSS-C also accepts papers on computational statistics, machine learning and data science, if they are engaging with an application as outlined above. Papers where the application merely serves as an illustration for new methodology or papers that use well-established statistical methods to analyze data are not suitable for JRSS-C. Similarly, papers that only contain brief numerical illustrations or focus exclusively on simulation studies are not suitable, although numerical illustrations and simulations may of course form part of a JRSS-C paper.  
	- In terms of application areas and methodologies, _Series C_ tries to be as broad as possible and therefore covers the whole range of interdisciplinary fields where statistics is applied, including but being by no means limited to agriculture, biology, chemistry, ecology, economics, genetics, industry, medicine, physics, and social sciences.
- [Environmetrics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1099095x)
	- _Environmetrics_, the official journal of The International Environmetrics Society (TIES), an Association of the [International Statistical Institute](http://www.isi-web.org/), is devoted to disseminating high-quality quantitative research in the environmental sciences. The journal welcomes pertinent and innovative submissions from quantitative disciplines developing new statistical models, methods, and theories that solve modern environmental problems. Articles must proffer substantive statistical advances to answer important scientific questions in the environmental sciences, or must develop novel or enhanced statistical methodology with clear applications to environmental science. New methods should be illustrated with recent environmental data.

	- The journal does **not** publish articles that essentially reproduce the protocol for an individual clinical trial. Articles that simply report the results of a completed clinical trial are also not considered.
- [Trials](https://link.springer.com/journal/13063/aims-and-scope)
	- _Trials_ encompasses all aspects of the performance and findings of randomized controlled trials in human health. We publish articles on general trial methodology and research into trial processes, as well as study protocols and statistical analysis plans for randomised controlled trials, commentaries and traditional results papers - regardless of outcome or significance of findings.
	- Our aim is to promote transparency in the reporting of randomised trials and build an evidence base that will help inform the design and reporting of future trials. Within this remit, we consider articles or study protocols assessing aspects of the design, conduct or reporting of trials, as well as assessment and evaluation of lessons learnt from past trials, including those that were prematurely ended. We advocate for the collective success for trials and the importance of linking publications together (the thread of evidence).
### Epidemiology

	- Also covered are new methods, epidemiological and statistical, for the analysis of data used by those who practise social and preventive medicine. The _International Journal of Epidemiology_ is published six times yearly.
- [Journal of Clinical Epidemiology](https://www.jclinepi.com)
	- The _Journal of Clinical Epidemiology_ (JCE) aims to advance science that can improve health care decision-making and contribute to the evolving discipline of clinical epidemiology. The JCE publishes methods-focused articles across the spectrum of the research ecosystem, including primary research (qualitative, quantitative, and mixed); evidence syntheses; guidelines; and implementation science. The journal welcomes registered reports, protocols, and simulation studies that advance the journal’s aims. The JCE is committed to promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion across all its content, contributors, editorial board, and leadership. Priority is given to contributions from early and mid-career researchers and low- and middle-income countries.
	- The journal publishes topics including:
		- Meta-science
		- Patient-oriented researc
		- Development, evaluation, and implementation of reporting guidelines 
		- Research integrity and culture
		- Open science
		- Emerging methodologies 
		- Developing and evaluating outcome measures
		- Education and learning programs for clinical epidemiologist
	- The JCE does not accept the following submissions except in exceptional circumstances: 
		- Bibliometric studies and those on infodemiology, social media trends, and health informatics
		- Papers written primarily for a statistical audience 
		- Artificial intelligence and machine learning studies without critical evaluation of the method and transparent reporting
		- Meta-research studies that demonstrate weaknesses or limitations in the evidence ecosystem but lack reflection on how these might be addressed
		- Effectiveness studies, including Mendelian randomization studies and target trial emulations; systematic reviews; prevalence and incidence studies; prognostic or diagnostic research where the main focus is not on the methods
		- Studies limited to one country, jurisdiction, or clinical area with limited generalizability, such as: translating an outcome measure into a different language; a study focused on one clinical specialty; a Delphi/consensus-based study where all the authors are from one country; or a survey of participants from one setting or with a limited response rate
		- Studies with a single author where it was more appropriate for a multi-disciplinary team to conduct the research
		- Studies that do not include patient partners as members of the research team in circumstances where that would be considered essential
		- Animal studies 
		- Pharmacovigilance and pharmacoepidemiology studies

- [Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics](https://www.aera.net/Publications/Journals/Journal-of-Educational-Behavioral-Statistics)
	- The _Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics_ provides an outlet for papers that are original and useful to those applying statistical approaches to problems and issues in educational or behavioral research. Typical papers will present new methods of analysis. In addition, critical reviews of current practice, tutorial presentations of less well known methods, and novel applications of already-known methods will be published. Papers discussing statistical techniques without specific educational or behavioral interest will have lower priority.

- [Statistical Science](https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/statistical-science/)
	- The central purpose of _Statistical Science_ is to convey the richness, breadth and unity of the field by presenting the full range of contemporary statistical thought at a moderate technical level, accessible to the wide community of practitioners, researchers and students of statistics and probability. It complements the main scientific journals of the IMS (the four series of the Annals) by coordinating, integrating and explicating important current statistical research. In line with this goal, the journal will publish reviews of influential new methodological and theoretical topics, articles describing substantive areas of scientific research with promising statistical applications, interviews with distinguished statisticians and probabilists, and articles on the history of statistics and probability.

		1. A paper that follows the usual theory and methods format and focuses on publishing a slew of new results is not suitable for STS. In particular, papers that have previously been submitted to such journals and have been rejected should not be resubmitted to STS directly, since such papers are likely to be quickly rejected. Similarly, papers that primarily deal with case studies are also not suitable for Statistical Science.
		2. While a core purpose of Statistical Science is reviews of statistical areas of interest, the journal does allow technical results (and often publishes such) provided they are placed in a larger review context.
	- We understand that there might be papers that fall in a grey zone between (a) and (b), in which case, it is the prerogative of the editor and the review team to make a call as to how to proceed.
